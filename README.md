# Description

This chronicles all the code I wrote for the __Coursera__ MOOC [Algorithmic Toolbox] (https://www.coursera.org/learn/algorithmic-toolbox).

I highly recommend this course and [its associated specialization] (https://www.coursera.org/specializations/data-structures-algorithms) to anyone learning how to code.

I am *not giving access to the assignment specifications themselves* which I do not own.

# Note for Current MOOC Students

__IF YOU COME ACROSS THIS REPOSITORY, PLEASE TRY TO DO ALL THE ASSIGNMENTS YOURSELF FIRST. OR ELSE YOU WON'T LEARN ANYTHING!__

Ultimately, the point of this repository is to save a record of my progress through coding. I am a self-taught programmer and such records are invaluable fall-backs to remind myself of things I might have forgotten.
